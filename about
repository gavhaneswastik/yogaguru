Project Title: Yoga Pose Detection and Feedback System
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for detecting yoga poses and providing corrective feedback based on real-time video frames. The solution uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify yoga poses and analyze posture alignment. The entire project runs locally, eliminating the need for complex front-end or back-end development.

Key Features:
Real-Time Pose Detection:

Captures frames directly from a webcam using OpenCV.
Utilizes MediaPipe to detect key body landmarks (e.g., shoulders, elbows, knees).
Pose Classification:

Classifies detected poses (e.g., Downward Dog, Warrior, and Plank) using a TensorFlow deep learning model trained on extracted keypoints.
Personalized Feedback:

Provides alignment suggestions based on the detected pose (e.g., "Keep your back straight for a plank").
Highlights common alignment errors using visual and text-based feedback.
Real-Time Visualization:

Displays webcam feed with overlaid pose landmarks and feedback using OpenCV.
Outputs pose classification and feedback directly in the console or on the video frame.
Workflow:
Data Capture:

Webcam captures live video frames.
Pose Detection:

MediaPipe processes each frame to extract body landmarks (e.g., joint positions like shoulders, elbows, and knees).
Pose Classification:

The extracted landmarks are flattened and passed to the trained TensorFlow model for pose classification.
Feedback Generation:

Simple rules (e.g., checking joint angles) provide corrective feedback for alignment.
Visualization:

Real-time landmarks are drawn on the video feed using OpenCV.
Feedback is displayed directly on the webcam feed.
Technology Stack:
Pose Detection: MediaPipe for extracting body landmarks.
Model Training: TensorFlow/Keras for pose classification.
Real-Time Video Processing: OpenCV for capturing video and rendering output.
Programming Language: Python.
Implementation Highlights:
Pose Detection:

MediaPipe extracts 33 key body landmarks per frame, providing a detailed map of the userâ€™s posture.
Model Training:

The model is trained using labeled datasets of yoga poses, such as Yoga-82 or Kaggle Yoga Pose datasets.
Features are extracted as flattened landmark coordinates (x, y, z).
Feedback Logic:

For each classified pose, alignment is checked using simple rules (e.g., joint angle thresholds).
Visualization:

Keypoints and pose connections are overlaid on the video feed in real time.
Feedback is rendered as text on the video feed using OpenCV's drawing utilities.
Applications:
Yoga Practice:

Acts as a personal yoga trainer to help users maintain correct posture and avoid injuries.
Fitness Monitoring:

Provides real-time feedback to improve overall fitness routines.
Rehabilitation and Therapy:

Helps physical therapists monitor patient movements and ensure proper alignment during exercises.
Future Enhancements:
Advanced Feedback:

Incorporate advanced metrics such as joint angles and symmetry for precise alignment analysis.
Additional Poses:

Expand the system to recognize more yoga poses for a wider range of applications.
Mobile Deployment:

Use TensorFlow Lite to deploy the system on mobile devices for portability.
Integration with Wearables:

Incorporate data from wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) to enhance pose detection accuracy.
Conclusion:
The Yoga Pose Detection and Feedback System is a standalone, AI-driven solution that simplifies yoga practice by offering real-time posture detection and correction. With its ability to run locally without requiring web-based infrastructure, it is both accessible and efficient, making it suitable for personal use or integration into larger systems.
