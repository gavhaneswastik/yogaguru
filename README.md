Yoga Pose Detection and Feedback System
Project Overview:
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered system for detecting yoga poses and providing corrective feedback based on real-time video frames. The solution uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify yoga poses and analyze posture alignment. The entire project runs locally, eliminating the need for complex front-end or back-end development.
